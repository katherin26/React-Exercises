# **CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REACT APP, ALAN AI**

## **Install dependecies** :

1. npm i @alan-ai/alan-sdk-web : This is going to allow us to use all the voice capabilities.
2. @material-ui/core : That's the ui kit we are going to use for styling
3. classnames: because we are going to have multiple components that have multiple class names.
4. words-to-numbers: when we use the command open article number 15 we need to parse the words 15 to actual numbers .

## **ALAN I**

1. in (studio.alan.app) ===> or just look in google Alan AI
2. Create a new project
3. we can see an intent('hello world', p => { p.play('(hello|hi there))}) ===> **This is your voice command and the response.**
   4.How do we actually connect it and get the key, well you go to :
   ** </> Integrations** and then in here you get the **Alan SDK Key** you just copy it , go back to our
   application and simply paste it there.
